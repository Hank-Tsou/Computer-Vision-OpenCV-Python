# Image Pyramids

## Outline
- Image pyramid
    - Gaussian pyramid
    - Laplacian pyramid

### Image Pyramids
```
- Input image: dog.jpg
- Command Line: python Image_Pyramid.py -i dog.jpg
```
#### 1. Gaussian pyramids
```
Gaussian pyramids is constructed by calculating a weighted average of the neighboring pixels of a 
source image and scaling the image down.
```
#### 2. Laplacian pyramids
