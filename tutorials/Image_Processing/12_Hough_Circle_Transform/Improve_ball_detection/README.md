## Hough Circle Transform - Improve ball detection
```
NOTE: The description is same as previous page "12_Hough_Circle_Transform"
```
```
Folder name: Improve_ball_detection
File name: hough_circle.py
Command: python hough_circle.py
```
### Step of the process
* (1) Use color information to select pool table
* (2) Canny Edge Detection
* (3) Apply mask for the pool table then find contour for the ball
* (4) Hough Circle Transform

```
The process and result of the improvement show as below:
